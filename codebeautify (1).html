	<body>This is the first "Bug Fix" of the semester. The goal of this is to provide you with the "real world experience" of having to fix broken code... Once you finish fixing the code, click the run button and then download your code....That will be submitted for a grade. Please make sure you check that all of the tags make sense and are correct in spelling.
